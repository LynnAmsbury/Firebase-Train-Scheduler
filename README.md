# Firebase-Train-Scheduler

A mock train scheduling database that uses Firebase and Moment.js to allow users to interact with the train scheduling program.

Visit the project at https://lynnamsbury.github.io/Firebase-Train-Scheduler/

Overview:

In this assignment, create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Instructions:

Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:

When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view the same train times.
